# AGER
A Gameboy emulator coded in Rust, serves as a first project to learn Rust.

The goal is to implement a Gameboy emulator that replicates a real machine as closely as can be (especially in the typical gameboy quirks: OAM trash write, HALT skip instructions...)

## Features planned
- Debugger with full control flow capabilities (Step, Back)
- Memory editor and live viewer
- Custom shaders for rendering (OpenGL)
- Mappable controls
- Controller support
- Cheats support
- CPU Speed control
- Custom color palette
